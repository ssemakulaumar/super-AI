A python AI with voice interaction and can rune in background, fully access to all computer programs, files and interact with them in real time with full internet access, interacts with different online servers and APIs and ability to find valuable access, verify transfers and transactions from all online accessibble accounts.

Usage:

    Save this script to a file, for example, auto_update.py.
    Run the script by double-clicking it or running it from the command line with python auto_update.py.

Before running the script, make sure Git, Python, and pip are installed and available in your PATH. If not, follow the manual installation instructions provided in the install_prerequisites function.

Adjustments for Windows:

    Checking prerequisites: The script checks for the presence of Git, Python, and pip.
    Manual installation instructions: For installing prerequisites, the script provides manual installation instructions because automating installations on Windows is more complex and typically requires user interaction.
    Command adjustments: Uses python and pip commands which are common in Windows environments.
    No root check: Windows doesn't have the same concept of root users as Unix-like systems, so that check is removed.

Key Updates:

    Configuration File: A config.json file is used to store the username and password securely. If the file does not exist, the script prompts the user to input these details and then saves them.
    Set Environment Variables: The script sets environment variables using the values from the configuration file or user input if the file is not present.
    Persistence Across Runs: The configuration file ensures that the environment variables persist across script runs, so the user does not need to input them each time.

This setup maintains the security of credentials and provides a seamless experience for the user.

To enable the script to update itself with new self-written scripts, gain more access, handle self-awareness and upgrades, and commit changes to a GitHub repository, you'll need to add several functionalities. Hereâ€™s how you can do this:

    Self-Writing and Self-Modification: The script will generate and append new scripts to itself.
    Self-Awareness: The script will include logging and checks to understand its current state.
    Self-Upgrading: The script will update itself and commit changes to the GitHub repository.
    GitHub Integration: The script will use Git commands to commit and push changes.

Key Additions:

    Append New Script: The append_new_script function allows adding new code to the main file.
    Commit Changes: The commit_changes function uses Git commands to add, commit, and push changes to the GitHub repository.
    Self-Update Mechanism: The script now includes functions to update itself and commit those updates to the GitHub repository.

Online and Offline Operation: The script checks for an internet connection and uses Google's API for online voice recognition and pocketsphinx for offline recognition.
Automatic Package Installation: The script checks and installs the required packages if they are missing.
Secure Credentials Handling: Environment variables are used for secure handling of login credentials.
Enhanced Voice Commands: Added more complex interactions, including opening applications and switching displays.

Usage:

    Append New Script: Add new code snippets dynamically by calling append_new_script(new_code).
    Commit Changes: Commit these changes to the GitHub repository using commit_changes() after appending the new script.

This setup allows the script to modify itself, commit these modifications to the repository, and maintain self-awareness and upgrades.
