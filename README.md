Adjustments for Windows:

    Checking prerequisites: The script checks for the presence of Git, Python, and pip.
    Manual installation instructions: For installing prerequisites, the script provides manual installation instructions because automating installations on Windows is more complex and typically requires user interaction.
    Command adjustments: Uses python and pip commands which are common in Windows environments.
    No root check: Windows doesn't have the same concept of root users as Unix-like systems, so that check is removed.
